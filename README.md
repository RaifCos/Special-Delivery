**Special Delivery** is a chaotic driving game all about delivering parcels as you face an ever-growing barrage of obstacles!

Take on the role of an underpaid delivery driver as you navigate a bustling city in your trusty van, racing against the clock to pick up and drop off as many parcels as you can. Sounds simple, right? Well, there is a tiny hitch- each delivery you complete will throw another obstacle in your path, from speeding cars to runaway dumpsters, falling pianos and UFOs, things will escalate quickly as you deliver more parcels.

- Take to the streets in your mail van to deliver parcels as fast as you can.
- Put up with more and more nonsense as you complete more deliveries, with 23 different obstacles to encounter.
- Put your skills to the test with 12 different achievements to complete.
- Earn wages for completing deliveries, which can be used in the garage to unlock 9 awesome upgrades. 

This game is an early prototype, orignally designed for a University Project. It might be a little rough around the edges! Special Delivery is available to play on Itch.io for Free [here](https://raf03.itch.io/special-delivery).
