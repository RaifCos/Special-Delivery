**Special Delivery** is a chaotic driving game all about delivering parcels as you face an ever-growing barrage of obstacles!

Take on the role of an underpaid delivery driver as you navigate a bustling city in your trusty van, racing against the clock to pick up and drop off as many parcels as you can. Sounds simple, right? Well, there is a tiny hitch- each delivery you complete will throw another obstacle in your path, from speeding cars to runaway dumpsters, falling pianos and UFOs, things escalate quickly as you deliver more parcels.

• Encounter 23 different obstacles trying to slow you down.
• Put your skills to the test with 12 different achievements to complete.

This game is an early prototype, orignally designed for a University Project. It might be a little rough around the edges! Special Delivery is available to play on Itch.io for Free [here](https://raf03.itch.io/special-delivery).
