  description: 'snowballs roll across the stage, shrinking but speeding up along
    the way.


    these snowballs don''t leave behind a trail of snow, but rather
    a path destruction and various debris- which isn''t as fun :('
  headline: '"world''s largest snowball fight" being held downtown today, despite
    complete lack of snow.'
